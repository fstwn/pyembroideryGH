# pyembroideryGH

- This is an set of UserObjects for [Grasshopper](https://www.rhino3d.com/6/new/grasshopper).
- Grasshopper is a Plugin for the popular CAD-System [McNeel Rhinoceros 6](https://www.rhino3d.com/).
- All code here is written in IronPython 2.7.8.0 as this is the interpreter Rhino & Grasshopper use internally.

## Purpose & Origins

The purpose of this project is to enable Grasshopper to directly read, write and manipulate a variety of embroidery formats. This implementation relies on [ironpyembroidery](https://github.com/fstwn/ironpyembroidery/), which is an IronPython-compatible fork of [pyembroidery](https://github.com/EmbroidePy/pyembroidery/).

**The ironpyembroidery library is included here as a submodule, so you don't have to get it separately when installing! For more info read below.**

## Installing pyembroideryGH
